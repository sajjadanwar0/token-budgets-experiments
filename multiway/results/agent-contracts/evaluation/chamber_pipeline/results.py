"""Run-result records for the chamber pillar's sweep experiments.

Each cell of the §6.1 cell grid (chamber x budget x variant x seed)
produces exactly one `RunRecord` describing what happened. Records are
collected by the orchestrator, serialized to Parquet/CSV at sweep
end, and consumed by the analysis layer (M5+) to produce the §5.3
Pareto figure.

Design choices:

- **Frozen dataclass.** Sweep results are append-only by construction —
  what gets written to disk is what was computed. Mutability would
  invite "I tweaked this number after the run" bugs that are hard to
  catch in a 1620-row Parquet.
- **Explicit success vs skip vs error.** Three terminal states a cell
  can land in: `ok` (agent ran and produced an adjacency), `skipped`
  (agent isn't compatible with this chamber — e.g., GreedyIG-lite on
  WT per plan §5.1), `error` (agent raised an unexpected exception).
  The orchestrator never crashes on per-cell failures; one bad cell
  doesn't lose the surrounding 449.
- **Metadata flat, not nested.** Pandas / Parquet read flat schemas
  cleanly; nested dicts force JSON-blob columns that are awkward to
  query. Keep all fields scalar.
- **Optional LLM/PC fields default to None, not 0.** "0 LLM calls"
  is a meaningful claim about a non-LLM variant; "no measurement"
  is a different thing for a variant that doesn't track that axis.
  None → nullable column in Parquet; 0 → counted-as-zero.

class RunRecord:
    """One cell of a chamber sweep — a single (chamber, budget, agent, seed) run.

    Required fields are immutable identity (which cell this is) plus
    status. Optional fields carry per-cell measurements that may be
    None when not applicable (e.g., scoring fields are None for
    skipped cells; LLM-call fields are None for non-LLM variants).

    Attributes:
        chamber: Chamber identifier ("lt" or "wt").
        configuration: Chamber configuration ("standard" or
            "pressure-control"). Plan §6.1 holds this constant per
            chamber, but the field is kept for forward-compat with
            future ablation sweeps.
        agent_name: Variant name as registered in `AGENT_REGISTRY`
            (e.g., "random", "greedy_ig_lite", "llm_pc").
        budget_k: Intervention-budget cell value (`per_tool_limits["intervene"]`).
        budget_fraction: `budget_k / menu_size` — the §6.1 x-axis value.
            Carried for analysis convenience so plotters don't need
            to recompute menu sizes per chamber.
        seed: RNG seed for this cell.
        status: One of "ok" / "skipped" / "error".
        shd: Structural Hamming Distance vs ground truth. None for
            non-"ok" cells.
        f1: F1 score on edge presence. None for non-"ok" cells.
        n_edges_predicted: Count of 1-entries in the predicted
            adjacency (excluding diagonal). None for non-"ok" cells.
        n_edges_truth: Count of 1-entries in the ground-truth
            adjacency. Constant per chamber but recorded per row for
            flat-schema convenience.
        wall_time_seconds: How long the agent took (excluding adapter
            load + scoring). None for skipped/error cells.
        n_llm_calls: How many times the agent invoked the LLM
            callable. None for non-LLM variants. 0 is a real
            measurement (e.g., budget=0 short-circuit).
        n_pc_degeneracies: How many times PC's singular-matrix
            fallback fired during this cell. Captured by a logging
            handler the orchestrator installs around each cell. None
            if the cell didn't run PC at all (LLM-only variant).
        tokens_in: Cumulative input/prompt tokens spent on this cell's
            LLM calls. None for non-LLM variants and for cells whose
            LLM target doesn't report a usage block (e.g., FakeLLM).
        tokens_out: Same but for output/completion tokens.
        cost_usd: Cumulative cost in USD for this cell's LLM calls,
            read from `_hidden_params.response_cost` when LiteLLM
            populates it. None when the LLM target doesn't report.
        error_type: Exception class name for "error" cells; None
            otherwise.
        error_message: First 500 chars of the exception message for
            "error" cells; None otherwise. (Truncated to keep
            Parquet rows compact.)
        skip_reason: Free-text reason the cell was skipped. None
            unless status == "skipped". Typical: "agent
            incompatible with chamber" with the underlying
            NotImplementedError message.
        started_at: ISO 8601 timestamp at agent-call start.
        finished_at: ISO 8601 timestamp at agent-call end (whether
            ok / error). Useful for sweep-runtime accounting.
