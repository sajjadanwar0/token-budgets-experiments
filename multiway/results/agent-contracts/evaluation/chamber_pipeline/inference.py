"""Causal-discovery inference helpers for the chamber pillar.

Currently wraps the PC algorithm from `causal-learn` so the Random and
LLM+PC variants in `agents.py` (and any future score-based variants) can
share a single conversion step from raw chamber measurements to a
directed adjacency-matrix DataFrame.

Data convention used here: chamber experiments record measurements of
all chamber variables plus an `intervention` meta-column logging which
variable was perturbed. We pool the rows from all spent experiments and
drop the meta-column before passing to PC. This is the simple "PC on
pooled interventional data" baseline. M3+ may swap in interventional-
aware methods (IPM, GIES, etc.) when method-axis breadth becomes the
primary contribution; for the AAMAS submission, PC-on-pool is the
single classical inference step shared across the LLM+PC and Random
variants per plan §5.

CPDAG → directed-adjacency convention:

    PC outputs a CPDAG (Markov equivalence class), not a DAG. For an
    undirected edge i — j, the data is consistent with both i → j and
    j → i. We convert by reporting *both* directions in the binary
    adjacency matrix, surfacing the agent's uncertainty to the SHD
    scorer rather than making an arbitrary orientation choice. Cost:
    exactly +1 false positive per undirected edge under the cell-wise
    SHD convention used by `evaluation.chamber_pipeline.scoring.shd`.

    causal-learn's `pc_graph[i, j]` represents the endpoint of the i—j
    edge **at node i** (NOT j — easy to misread). Values:

        pc_graph[i, j] =  1  →  arrowhead at i
        pc_graph[i, j] = -1  →  tail at i
        pc_graph[i, j] =  0  →  no edge

    So a definite arrow i → j (head at j, tail at i) is encoded as
    `pc_graph[j, i] = 1` (head at j) AND `pc_graph[i, j] = -1` (tail at i).
    An undirected edge i — j is `pc_graph[i, j] = -1` AND
    `pc_graph[j, i] = -1` (tails at both ends).

    Therefore:
        `adj[i, j] = 1` iff
            `pc_graph[j, i] == 1`                                      (arrowhead at j from i)
            OR (`pc_graph[i, j] == -1` AND `pc_graph[j, i] == -1`)     (undirected — both dirs)
