"""Causal-discovery agents for the chamber pillar.

Each agent is a callable matching `ContractedChamberAgent.run`'s
expected signature:

    def agent(adapter: ContractedChamberAgent, **kwargs) -> pd.DataFrame

It is passed a contract-wrapped chamber adapter, spends some prefix of
the adapter's `per_tool_limits["intervene"]` budget by calling
`adapter.query_intervention(...)`, and returns a directed adjacency
matrix DataFrame indexed by the chamber's ground-truth node names.

Agents (per plan §5):

| # | Variant            | Architecture | Method               | Status |
|---|--------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | random             | single-agent | naive                | M3a ✅ |
| 2 | greedy_ig_lite     | single-agent | non-LLM, principled  | M3a ✅ |
| 3 | llm_only           | single-agent | LLM throughout       | M3b ✅ |
| 4 | llm_pc             | single-agent | LLM-orchestrated PC  | M3b ✅ |
| 5 | planner_reasoner   | multi-agent  | LLM, two roles       | M3c ✅ |

The R1 mitigation order from plan §11 is reflected here: Random and
GreedyIG-lite (no network, no API keys, fast unit tests) land first.
LLM-bearing variants land in M3b/M3c with mocked LiteLLM in tests.

All agents return a directed-adjacency DataFrame in the convention
documented in `inference.cpdag_to_directed_adjacency`: undirected
edges from PC are reported in both directions; definite arrows in
their oriented direction.

    Plan §5.1 variant 2: "principled non-LLM baseline." The "lite"
    qualifier matters — full Bayesian variance reduction over the DAG
    posterior is deferred to a v2 / journal extension per the plan.
    What we implement here is the cleanest defensible greedy
    information-gain proxy that doesn't need posterior maintenance:

    **Greedy target-coverage**: at each step, prefer interventions
    targeting variables we haven't yet perturbed. Once every variable
    in the menu has been perturbed at least once, fall back to random
    selection over the remaining experiments. Run PC once on the
    pooled data at the end.

    Why this counts as "greedy variance reduction in the MAP-graph
    posterior" (the plan's wording):

    - For a linear-Gaussian SCM, Hauser & Bühlmann (2014) show that
      single-target interventions on previously-unperturbed variables
      strictly reduce the size of the interventional-Markov equivalence
      class (I-MEC). Greedy target coverage is therefore a
      monotone-improving I-MEC reduction policy, which is exactly the
      "approximate variance reduction in the MAP-graph posterior"
      semantics the plan calls out, modulo a constant-factor approximation.
    - It needs no Bayesian machinery — no DAG sampling, no MCMC, no
      score caching. One PC fit per run vs. O(menu_size · budget) for
      naive expected-IG. Honest about being "lite".

    Spending pattern: spends exactly `min(budget, len(menu))`
    interventions, one per call to `query_intervention`. Failed PC
    fits (rare on real chamber data, but possible for degenerate
    pooled inputs) return the all-zeros adjacency so callers always
    get a coherent shape.

    Args:
        adapter: Contract-wrapped chamber adapter.
        seed: RNG seed for shuffling within target-coverage tiers
            (controls tie-breaking when multiple unspent targets
            remain).
        pc_alpha: PC independence-test significance level.

    """Planner + Reasoner under conservation A + B <= total. Plan §5.1 variant 5.

    The contribution-load-bearing variant. Two LLM-driven phases share
    the chamber adapter's intervention budget under an explicit
    conservation law (A + B <= k_intervene), and a single PC inference
    consumes the union of the experiments both phases queried. The
    headline comparison vs. `llm_pc_agent` (variant 4) is plan §5.3:
    if Planner+Reasoner sits on or above LLM+PC at matched total
    budget, that's direct evidence the framework's conservation laws
    preserve quality under delegation.

    Phase split:
        - Planner (budget A): broad exploration. Sees the chamber menu
          and a planner-framed system message asking it to pick
          experiments that give the Reasoner a useful baseline.
        - Reasoner (budget B): targeted refinement. Sees the menu plus
          the Planner's picks (via the prompt's `already_chosen` block)
          and a reasoner-framed system message asking it to pick
          experiments that complement the Planner's choices.
        - Inference: PC on the pooled data of all (A + B) experiments.
          Same inference step as `llm_pc_agent` to keep the §5.3
          comparison clean — only the *selection policy* differs.

    Conservation enforcement:
        - Both sub-budgets are allocated via
          `ContractingCapability.create_subcontract` BEFORE either
          phase runs. As of the per-tool delegation refactor, the
          framework primitive enforces conservation on
          `per_tool_limits` — so if A + B > k_intervene, the second
          `create_subcontract` raises `ConservationViolationError`
          before any LLM call (no API spend on a contract that can't
          legally execute).
        - This is the AAMAS plan §5 line 76-77 claim — "delegation
          primitives — not just per_tool_limits — are exercised" —
          implemented as a single framework primitive: the same
          method records the audit trail and enforces the
          conservation law.

    Args:
        adapter: Contract-wrapped chamber adapter. Its
            `per_tool_limits["intervene"]` is the total k that
            A + B must satisfy.
        planner_budget: A — interventions allocated to the Planner.
            Non-negative. A=0 means the Reasoner runs alone.
        reasoner_budget: B — interventions allocated to the Reasoner.
            Non-negative. B=0 means the Planner runs alone (the
            variant degenerates to llm_pc with budget A).
        model: LiteLLM model identifier. Defaults per plan §5.
        seed: RNG seed for both phases' fallback paths and PC's
            row-subsampling. Both phases share the seed; randomness
            is only used on bad LLM outputs.
        pc_alpha: PC independence-test significance level.
        llm: Injectable LLM callable for testing.

    Returns:
        Directed-adjacency DataFrame indexed by chamber node names.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either sub-budget is negative.
        ConservationViolationError: If A + B > k_intervene.
