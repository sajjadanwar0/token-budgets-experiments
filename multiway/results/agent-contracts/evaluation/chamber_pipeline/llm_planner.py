"""Prompt construction and response parsing for LLM-bearing chamber agents.

Used by `agents.llm_only_agent` (M3b) and `agents.llm_pc_agent` (M3b). Kept
as pure functions in a separate module so unit tests don't need the
`causalchamber` extra installed and don't need network access — the
planner is testable against synthetic LLM responses in isolation.

Design choices (per plan §5 + the M3b "menu only at planning time" decision):

- **Selection prompt is opaque-menu only**: the LLM sees `available_experiments()`
  as a string list. No node-name list, no parsed `target -> experiments`
  mapping. This is the strongest baseline-honesty stance — the LLM must
  infer what the menu encodes from naming alone, exactly as a domain-naive
  agent would. See §6.5 of the validation plan for the comparison rationale.
- **Adjacency-emission prompt does reveal node names**: this is the *output
  schema*, not a planning-time hint. If we hid node names here, `llm_only`
  literally couldn't produce a well-typed answer. The leak is at the output
  stage and applies only to `llm_only_agent` (the LLM-emits-graph variant);
  `llm_pc_agent` never invokes `build_adjacency_prompt`.
- **Failure-tolerant parsing**: malformed selection responses return None,
  malformed adjacency responses return all-zeros. Callers (the agents) are
  responsible for fallback policy (random pick / no-edge baseline). This
  keeps prompt parsing pure and predictable; the agent decides what to do
  with garbage.

The `_response_text` helper accepts both dict-like and Pydantic-like
LiteLLM completion responses, mirroring how `litellm_wrapper.py` already
handles the same shape variation in production.

    Used by `build_adjacency_prompt` (when invoked via `llm_only_agent`)

    Without this summary, `llm_only_agent` reduces to "commit a graph
    based on names alone," which empirically yields the empty graph
    (verified in the M4b smoke run, 2026-05-13).

    The output is markdown rather than CSV so a curious reader of the
    LLM trace sees something legible. Rows are experiments (preserving
    the order in `chosen_names`); columns are the chamber's graph nodes
    (preserving the order in `node_names`). Non-node columns (timestamp,
    counter, intervention, etc.) are dropped.

    Each cell is the within-experiment mean of that node, rounded to
    `decimals` places. Standard deviations are *not* included in v1 —
    the LLM can implicitly gauge dynamic range by comparing means
    across experiments, which is cheaper in tokens. If smoke results
    show insufficient signal, std can be added behind the same call.

    Args:
        experiment_dfs: Per-experiment measurement DataFrames, in the
            same order as `chosen_names`. Each DataFrame should have

        chosen_names: The experiment names spent so far (e.g.,
            `["uniform_red_mid", "uniform_green_mid"]`). The
            intervention target is encoded in the name; the LLM is
            expected to parse it.
        node_names: The chamber's ground-truth graph nodes. Only these
            columns appear in the summary; everything else is dropped.
        decimals: Rounding for the mean values. 2 is usually enough
            to surface intervention effects without bloating tokens.
