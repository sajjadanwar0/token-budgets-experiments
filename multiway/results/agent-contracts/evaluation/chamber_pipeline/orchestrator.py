"""Sweep orchestrator for the chamber pillar.

Owns the AgentSpec registry (the single source of truth for which
variants exist, which chambers each is compatible with, and what kwargs
each accepts), the per-cell runner `run_cell`, and the full-sweep
runner `run_sweep`. M4's `run_experiment.py` CLI is a thin wrapper
around `run_sweep`; the orchestrator itself has no CLI dependencies
and is fully testable with mocked LLM via the `llm` parameter.

Design (resolves the four open questions from M3 final review):

1. **Agent dispatch** (M3-review #5): AgentSpec registry. Each agent
   declares its name, callable, chamber compatibility, kwargs schema,
   and whether it accepts an injectable LLM. The orchestrator iterates
   the registry; per-cell dispatch is data-driven, not if/elif.

2. **Compatibility API** (M3-review #6): `AgentSpec.chambers` is a
   tuple of chamber-id strings the agent supports. The orchestrator
   filters BEFORE invoking — incompatible cells produce a "skipped"
   RunRecord, never a NotImplementedError mid-sweep. (The
   NotImplementedError raise inside the agent remains as a defensive
   double-check, but the registry is the contractual API.)

3. **Metadata aggregation** (M3-review #4): each cell installs a
   logging handler scoped to `evaluation.chamber_pipeline.inference`
   that captures PC-degeneracy warnings into a per-cell counter.
   Aggregated into the RunRecord's `n_pc_degeneracies` field — no
   log-scraping needed at analysis time.

4. **Sweep harness**: serial nested for-loop (chamber → budget →
   agent → seed). Parallelism deferred to M5 if M4 wall-time is a
   problem; the simpler design is easier to debug at pilot scale
   (450 cells) and the LLM API is the bottleneck anyway.

    The single source of truth for what a variant is, where it can
    run, and what kwargs it accepts. The orchestrator dispatches
    agents through this descriptor — callers don't import individual
    agent functions.

    Attributes:
        name: Short variant name (registry key). Matches the names
            used in `RunRecord.agent_name` and the §6.5 figure legend.
        run: The agent callable. Must match
            `agent(adapter, **kwargs) -> pd.DataFrame`.
        chambers: Tuple of chamber IDs this agent is compatible with.
            The orchestrator filters cells using this — incompatible
            chambers produce skipped RunRecords without ever invoking
            the agent. Tracks plan §5.1 footnotes (e.g.,
            GreedyIG-lite is LT-only: chambers=("lt",)).
        accepts_llm: True iff the agent accepts an `llm=` keyword.
            Lets the orchestrator decide whether to pass the
            injectable LLM callable (real `litellm.completion` or
            FakeLLM in tests).
        kind: Coarse classification — "non_llm" / "llm_single" /
            "llm_multi". Used by the orchestrator to decide whether
            to track LLM-specific metadata (`n_llm_calls`).
        extra_kwargs: Per-variant required kwargs that aren't
            seed/pc_alpha/llm. E.g., `planner_reasoner_agents`
            requires `planner_budget` and `reasoner_budget`. The
            orchestrator computes these per-cell from the cell's
            total budget.

    Either way, exposes `.calls` (list, length = number of invocations
    in this cell) and three running totals
    (`total_input_tokens`, `total_output_tokens`, `total_cost_usd`).

    Why "always wrap":
        Before this, `run_cell` had two code paths — one for the
        FakeLLM-style `.calls` attribute, one fall-through that left
        `n_llm_calls=None` on production runs. Always wrapping
        unifies the paths: the orchestrator instantiates a fresh
        `_CountingLLM` per cell, the user's LLM (if any) is invoked
        through it, and the counter is read off the wrapper after
        the cell finishes.

    Token / cost extraction:
        Best-effort. A response is checked for OpenAI-shaped
        `usage.prompt_tokens` / `usage.completion_tokens` (LiteLLM
        normalizes to this) and `_hidden_params.response_cost` (when
        LiteLLM populates it). If any field is missing — e.g., a
        FakeLLM whose response doesn't carry `usage` — the running
        totals stay at zero and the orchestrator records None on the

    Catches all exceptions per cell — this method NEVER raises (catches
    `Exception`, not `BaseException`, so KeyboardInterrupt still
    propagates by design — Ctrl-C should kill the sweep, not silently
    convert to an error record). Skipped, ok, and error cells all
    produce well-formed RunRecords with `status` set accordingly.

    Args:
        spec: The agent variant to run.
        chamber: Which chamber to load.
        configuration: Chamber configuration.
        budget_k: Total intervention budget for this cell.
        seed: RNG seed.
        pc_alpha: PC independence-test significance level (ignored for
            llm_only; passed through for all others).
        llm: Injectable LLM callable. None means lazy-import
            `litellm.completion` for the production path. Either way,
            the orchestrator wraps it in a `_CountingLLM` per cell so
            `n_llm_calls` / `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` / `cost_usd`
            are populated on the RunRecord.
        cell_timeout_seconds: Wall-clock timeout for the agent
            invocation (in seconds). None = no timeout. On timeout,
            the cell is recorded as `status="error"` with
            `error_type="TimeoutError"`. Note: the underlying thread
            is NOT killed (Python doesn't support thread-level
            cancellation), but the cell's slot in the sweep is freed
            and the next cell starts immediately. For M4b's serial
            sweep this is acceptable; M5's parallelism case will need
            stronger isolation.

    Returns:
        A RunRecord with status "ok" / "skipped" / "error".

    couldn't return because httpx wasn't honoring our socket-level

    manager's __exit__ waited for the worker.

    daemon=True ensures Python's process-exit atexit handler doesn't

    has no thread cancellation and openssl ignores signals) until
