"""Cost Governance Test - Demonstrates Organizational Policy Enforcement.

This test shows that the framework can enforce company-wide cost policies across
diverse queries of varying complexity.

## The Value Proposition

Organizations need to control AI spending through enforceable policies. The framework
enables "maximum cost per query" policies that prevent budget overruns.

## Test Design

Scenario: Company policy - "Maximum $0.01 per query"

Test with questions of varying complexity:
1. SIMPLE questions: Should complete within policy
2. MEDIUM questions: May require budget-aware strategies
3. COMPLEX questions: May exceed policy if uncontracted

For each question:
- Uncontracted: Run without limits (may violate policy)
- Contracted: Run with $0.01 hard limit

## Metrics

1. Policy compliance: Does framework enforce $0.01 limit?
2. Coverage: % of questions answerable within policy
3. Quality distribution: What quality is achievable?
4. Violations prevented: How many uncontracted queries exceed policy?

## Expected Result

- Contracted: 100% policy compliance
- Uncontracted: Some queries exceed policy
- Quality tradeoff: Complex questions may need lower quality to fit budget
