"""Strategic planning utilities for contract-governed agents.

This module implements strategic planning capabilities that enable agents to make
mode-aware decisions about resource allocation, task prioritization, and quality-cost-time
tradeoffs.

Key features:
- Resource allocation across subtasks
- Task prioritization based on contract mode
- Quality-cost-time tradeoff analysis
- Strategic recommendations based on budget state
