"""Contract delegation with conservation laws (Whitepaper Section 6).

This module implements contracting as an agent capability, allowing agents to
create subcontracts and delegate work to other agents while respecting
conservation laws that ensure hierarchical budget discipline.

The key insight is that contracting itself is a capability: an agent with
this capability can spawn sub-agents with their own contracts, enabling
recursive delegation and dynamic team formation.

Conservation Law:
    For any parent contract with budget B, if it creates child contracts
    with budgets b_1, b_2, ..., b_k, the following must hold:

        Σ b_i ≤ B - used

    where 'used' is the parent's own consumption.

Example:
    >>> from agent_contracts import Contract, ResourceConstraints
    >>> from agent_contracts.core.delegation import ContractingCapability
    >>>
    >>> # Parent contract with 100K tokens
    >>> parent = Contract(
    ...     id="orchestrator",
    ...     resources=ResourceConstraints(tokens=100_000)
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Create delegation capability
    >>> delegator = ContractingCapability(parent)
    >>>
    >>> # Allocate budget to child agents
    >>> researcher_contract = delegator.create_subcontract(
    ...     name="researcher",
    ...     tokens=40_000,
    ...     description="Research the topic"
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> analyzer_contract = delegator.create_subcontract(
    ...     name="analyzer",
    ...     tokens=30_000,
    ...     description="Analyze findings"
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Check remaining budget
    >>> print(delegator.remaining_budget)  # 30_000 (100K - 40K - 30K)

    This class implements "contracting as a capability" from the whitepaper.
    An agent with this capability can delegate work to other agents by

    The conservation law ensures that, on every axis the parent declares:
        parent_used + Σ child_budgets ≤ parent_budget

    Three axes are governed: tokens, cost, and per-tool call counts.
    A child request on an axis the parent doesn't declare (e.g.,
    `tokens=N` against a parent with `resources.tokens is None`) is
    treated as unconstrained — the framework allows it and does not
    track it for conservation. Use `parent_token_budget_constrained`,
    `parent_cost_budget_constrained`, and `parent_per_tool_limit(tool)`
    to disambiguate "no budget declared" from "zero budget declared."
