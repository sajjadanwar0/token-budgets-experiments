# Agent Contracts: A Resource-Bounded Optimization Framework for Autonomous AI Systems

**Abstract**

We introduce *Agent Contracts*, a formal framework for governing autonomous AI agents through explicit resource constraints and temporal boundaries. Drawing from contract theory, optimization theory, and resource allocation principles, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint system that transforms agent behavior from open-ended execution to bounded optimization. By defining contracts across computational resources (tokens, API calls), temporal constraints (deadlines, duration), and output specifications, we enable predictable, governable, and cost-effective agentic systems. We demonstrate how time-resource tradeoffs create a rich design space for agent specialization and show how contract-based coordination enables efficient multi-agent collaboration. This framework addresses critical gaps in current agentic systems: lifecycle management, resource governance, and formal verification of agent behavior.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Governance Gap in Agentic AI

The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents has introduced unprecedented autonomy in AI systems. Agents can now:
- Use tools and APIs through function calling
- Search the web and retrieve information
- Generate structured outputs
- Engage in multi-step reasoning and planning
- Coordinate with other agents in multi-agent systems

However, this autonomy creates significant challenges for production deployment:

**Resource Management**: Agents can consume unbounded computational resources (tokens, API calls, compute time) without explicit constraints, leading to unpredictable costs.

**Lifecycle Ambiguity**: Unlike traditional software with clear start/stop conditions, agents often lack explicit termination criteria, leading to resource leaks and unclear accountability.

**Governance and Compliance**: Organizations struggle to audit agent behavior, ensure compliance, and attribute costs when agent boundaries are implicit rather than explicit.

**Coordination Complexity**: Multi-agent systems lack formal mechanisms for resource allocation, task distribution, and conflict resolution.

### 1.2 From Implicit Constraints to Explicit Contracts

Current approaches to agent definition typically include:
- **System prompts**: Natural language instructions
- **Tool specifications**: Available functions and their schemas
- **Output formats**: Structured output schemas (JSON, XML)
- **Skills/capabilities**: Declarative descriptions of agent abilities

While these define *what* an agent can do, they fail to formalize:
- *How much* of each resource the agent may consume
- *How long* the agent has to complete its task
- *What tradeoffs* the agent should make under resource pressure
- *When* the agent's contract expires and resources should be released

**Agent Contracts** bridge this gap by providing a formal, executable specification that transforms agent operation from unbounded exploration to constrained optimization.

### 1.3 Theoretical Foundations

Agent Contracts draw from multiple theoretical traditions:

**Contract Theory** (Economics): Formal agreements that align incentives and define obligations, rights, and remedies between parties.

**Resource Allocation Theory** (Operations Research): Optimization under constraints, where scarce resources must be distributed among competing demands.

**Real-Time Systems** (Computer Science): Systems with explicit timing constraints where correctness depends not just on logical results but on meeting deadlines.

**Linear/Dynamic Programming** (Optimization Theory): Finding optimal solutions within feasible regions defined by constraint boundaries.

## 2. Formal Framework

### 2.1 Agent Contract Definition

An **Agent Contract** $C$ is a tuple:

$$C = (I, O, S, R, T, \Phi, \Psi)$$

Where:

- $I$: **Input specification** - Schema and constraints for acceptable inputs
- $O$: **Output specification** - Schema and quality criteria for outputs
- $S$: **Skills** - Set of capabilities (tools, functions, knowledge domains)
- $R$: **Resource constraints** - Multi-dimensional resource budget
- $T$: **Temporal constraints** - Time-related boundaries and deadlines
- $\Phi$: **Success criteria** - Measurable conditions for contract fulfillment
- $\Psi$: **Termination conditions** - Events that end the contract

### 2.2 Resource Constraint Space

The resource constraint $R$ defines a multi-dimensional budget:

$$R = \{r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\}$$

Common resource dimensions include:

| Resource | Symbol | Unit | Example Constraint |
|----------|--------|------|-------------------|
| LLM Tokens | $r_{tok}$ | tokens | 100,000 tokens |
| API Calls | $r_{api}$ | calls | 50 calls |
| Iterations | $r_{iter}$ | rounds | 10 rounds |
| Web Searches | $r_{web}$ | queries | 10 queries |
| Tool Invocations | $r_{tool}$ | invocations | 30 invocations |
| Memory/Storage | $r_{mem}$ | MB | 500 MB |
| Compute Time | $r_{cpu}$ | CPU-seconds | 300 seconds |
| External Cost | $r_{cost}$ | USD | $5.00 |

**Iteration Constraints**:

The iteration resource $r_{iter}$ deserves special attention in agentic systems. Unlike traditional software, agents often operate in loops:
- **ReAct loops**: Reasoning → Action → Observation cycles
- **Retry loops**: Automatic retries on failure or unsatisfactory results
- **Refinement loops**: Iterative improvement toward quality targets
- **Validation loops**: Repeated checks until criteria are met

Without explicit iteration limits, agents can enter runaway loops that consume unbounded resources. The iteration constraint provides a structural bound independent of token or time budgets:

$$c_{iter}(t) \leq b_{iter}$$

**Relationship to Other Resources**:

Iterations interact with other resources but are not reducible to them:
- High-token iterations vs. low-token iterations (orthogonal to $r_{tok}$)
- Fast iterations vs. slow iterations (orthogonal to $r_{cpu}$)
- Single-API iterations vs. multi-API iterations (orthogonal to $r_{api}$)

This independence makes $r_{iter}$ a critical safety constraint for preventing infinite loops in agentic systems.

Each resource $r_i$ has:
- **Budget** $b_i$: Total allocation
- **Consumption** $c_i(t)$: Amount used at time $t$
- **Rate limit** $\dot{r}_i$: Maximum consumption per time unit

**Constraint satisfaction** requires:
$$\forall i: c_i(t) \leq b_i \text{ and } \frac{dc_i}{dt} \leq \dot{r}_i$$

### 2.3 Token Budget Decomposition

Modern reasoning-capable LLMs distinguish between functionally different token types, creating a hierarchical structure within the token resource:

$$R_{tok} = (r_{input}, r_{reasoning}, r_{output})$$

Where:
- $r_{input}$: Tokens for task specification, context, and few-shot examples
- $r_{reasoning}$: Internal "thinking" tokens used for chain-of-thought, planning, and analysis (often hidden from user)
- $r_{output}$: Final response tokens visible to the user

**Token Type Characteristics**:

| Token Type | Visibility | Control | Strategic Role |
|------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Input | User-provided | Pre-determined | Task specification |
| Reasoning | Hidden (model internal) | Configurable budget | Depth of analysis |
| Output | Visible to user | Max tokens limit | Response comprehensiveness |

**The Reasoning-Output Tradeoff**:

Given a fixed total token budget $B_{tok}$, an agent must solve:

$$\max_{r_r, r_o} Q(r_r, r_o) \text{ subject to } r_r + r_o \leq B_{tok}$$

Where $Q(r_r, r_o)$ is the quality function dependent on reasoning and output allocation.

**Key Insight**: This creates a secondary optimization problem within the token budget:

1. **Deep Thinker Strategy** ($r_r >> r_o$): Allocate most tokens to reasoning
   - High analytical depth
   - Concise, well-reasoned output
   - Slower execution (more thinking)

2. **Verbose Explainer Strategy** ($r_o >> r_r$): Allocate most tokens to output
   - Shallow analysis
   - Comprehensive, detailed response
   - Faster execution (less thinking)

3. **Balanced Strategy** ($r_r \approx r_o$): Equal allocation
   - Moderate depth and coverage
   - Pareto-optimal for many tasks

**Formal Quality-Allocation Relationship**:

Empirically, quality often follows a concave function with diminishing returns:

$$Q(r_r, r_o) = \alpha \cdot \log(1 + r_r) + \beta \cdot \log(1 + r_o) + \gamma \cdot \sqrt{r_r \cdot r_o}$$

Where:
- $\alpha$: Weight of reasoning depth on quality
- $\beta$: Weight of output comprehensiveness on quality
- $\gamma$: Interaction term capturing reasoning-output synergy

The optimal allocation depends on task type:
- **Analytical tasks** (high $\alpha$): Favor reasoning allocation
- **Explanatory tasks** (high $\beta$): Favor output allocation
- **Balanced tasks** (high $\gamma$): Benefit from balanced allocation

### 2.4 Temporal Constraint Space

The temporal constraint $T$ defines time-related boundaries:

$$T = (t_{start}, t_{deadline}, \Delta t_{max}, \tau)$$

Where:
- $t_{start}$: Contract activation time
- $t_{deadline}$: Hard deadline for completion
- $\Delta t_{max}$: Maximum elapsed time (wall-clock)
- $\tau$: Contract duration/expiration (lifecycle limit)

**Temporal constraint types:**

**Hard Deadline**: Task must complete by $t_{deadline}$
$$t_{completion} \leq t_{deadline}$$

**Soft Deadline**: Task should complete by $t_{soft}$ with quality degradation after
$$Q(t) = \begin{cases}
Q_{max} & \text{if } t \leq t_{soft} \\
Q_{max} \cdot e^{-\lambda(t-t_{soft})} & \text{if } t > t_{soft}
\end{cases}$$

**Time Budget**: Maximum computation time regardless of wall-clock
$$\int_{t_{start}}^{t_{completion}} \mathbb{1}_{computing}(t) \, dt \leq \Delta t_{max}$$

**Contract Expiration**: Agent lifecycle terminates after duration $\tau$
$$t_{current} - t_{start} \geq \tau \implies \text{terminate contract}$$

### 2.5 The Time-Resource Tradeoff Surface

A fundamental property of Agent Contracts is the **time-resource tradeoff**, which creates a multi-dimensional feasible region for optimization.

**Tradeoff Function**: Given task complexity $\mathcal{C}$ and quality requirement $Q_{target}$, there exists a tradeoff surface:

$$f(t, r_1, r_2, ..., r_n) \geq \mathcal{C} \cdot Q_{target}$$

Where $t$ is time and $r_i$ are resource allocations.

**Key Insights:**

1. **Time-Token Tradeoff**: More time allows for sequential processing with lower token usage
   - Parallel processing: High tokens/API calls, low time
   - Sequential processing: Low tokens/API calls, high time

2. **Quality-Resource Tradeoff**: Higher quality requires more resources or time
   - Quick approximation: Low resources, low time, acceptable quality
   - Thorough analysis: High resources, high time, high quality

3. **Urgency Modes**:

**Urgent Mode** ($t$ constrained, $R$ relaxed):
```
max Q(t, R)
subject to: t ≤ t_deadline
            R ≤ R_max (relaxed)
```

**Economical Mode** ($R$ constrained, $t$ relaxed):
```
max Q(t, R)
subject to: R ≤ R_budget (strict)
            t ≤ t_max (relaxed)
```

**Balanced Mode** (both constrained):
```
max Q(t, R)
subject to: t ≤ t_deadline
            R ≤ R_budget
            α·t/t_deadline + β·R/R_budget ≤ 1
```

### 2.6 Agent Optimization Problem

Under a contract $C$, an agent solves:

$$\max_{a \in A} U(a, C)$$

Subject to:
$$\begin{align}
&c_i(t) \leq b_i & \forall i \in R \\
&t_{completion} \leq t_{deadline} \\
&O(a) \in \Phi \\
&a \text{ uses only skills in } S
\end{align}$$

Where:
- $A$: Set of possible action sequences
- $U(a, C)$: Utility function (task quality, completeness, accuracy)
- $O(a)$: Output produced by action sequence $a$

This transforms the agent from a general problem-solver into a **bounded optimizer** with clear objectives and constraints.

## 3. Contract Lifecycle and Dynamics

### 3.1 Contract States

An agent contract progresses through distinct states:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   DRAFTED   │ - Contract defined but not active
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   ACTIVE    │ - Agent executing within constraints
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├────→ ┌─────────────┐
       │      │  FULFILLED  │ - Success criteria met
       │      └─────────────┘
       │
       ├────→ ┌─────────────┐
       │      │   VIOLATED  │ - Constraints breached
       │      └─────────────┘
       │
       ├────→ ┌─────────────┐
       │      │   EXPIRED   │ - Time limit reached
       │      └─────────────┘
       │
       └────→ ┌─────────────┐
              │  TERMINATED │ - External cancellation
              └─────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Runtime Monitoring

During execution, the contract enforcement system monitors:

**Resource Consumption Tracking**:
```python
class ResourceMonitor:
    def __init__(self, contract: Contract):
        self.budget = contract.R
        self.consumed = {r: 0 for r in contract.R}
        self.start_time = time.time()

    def consume(self, resource: str, amount: float):
        self.consumed[resource] += amount
        if self.consumed[resource] > self.budget[resource]:
            raise ContractViolation(f"{resource} budget exceeded")

    def get_remaining(self, resource: str) -> float:
        return self.budget[resource] - self.consumed[resource]

    def get_utilization(self) -> dict:
        return {r: self.consumed[r] / self.budget[r]
                for r in self.budget}
```

**Temporal Compliance Checking**:
```python
class TemporalMonitor:
    def __init__(self, contract: Contract):
        self.deadline = contract.T.deadline
        self.max_duration = contract.T.max_duration
        self.start_time = time.time()

    def check_deadline(self) -> bool:
        if time.time() > self.deadline:
            raise DeadlineViolation()
        return True

    def get_time_pressure(self) -> float:
        elapsed = time.time() - self.start_time
        remaining = self.deadline - time.time()
        return elapsed / (elapsed + remaining)
```

### 3.3 Dynamic Resource Allocation

Agents can make runtime decisions based on budget state:

**Budget-Aware Planning**:
```python
class BudgetAwareAgent:
    def plan_action(self, task, remaining_budget):
        # Calculate expected resource usage for strategies
        strategies = [
            {
                "name": "thorough_web_search",
                "quality": 0.95,
                "cost": {"tokens": 30000, "web": 8, "time": 45}
            },
            {
                "name": "cached_knowledge",
                "quality": 0.75,
                "cost": {"tokens": 5000, "web": 0, "time": 10}
            },
            {
                "name": "hybrid_approach",
                "quality": 0.85,
                "cost": {"tokens": 15000, "web": 3, "time": 25}
            }
        ]

        # Filter feasible strategies
        feasible = [s for s in strategies
                    if all(s["cost"][r] <= remaining_budget[r]
                           for r in s["cost"])]

        # Select highest quality feasible strategy
        if feasible:
            return max(feasible, key=lambda s: s["quality"])
        else:
            return self.fallback_strategy(remaining_budget)
```

**Adaptive Quality-Resource Tradeoff**:
```python
def adaptive_strategy(self, budget_utilization: float):
    """Adjust strategy based on budget consumption rate"""

    if budget_utilization < 0.3:
        # Plenty of budget remaining
        return "high_quality_mode"
    elif budget_utilization < 0.7:
        # Moderate budget usage
        return "balanced_mode"
    else:
        # Budget nearly exhausted
        return "conservation_mode"
```

### 3.4 Contract Renegotiation

Contracts can be modified during execution:

**Extension Request**:
```python
class ContractNegotiation:
    def request_extension(self, agent_id: str,
                         additional_resources: dict,
                         justification: str) -> bool:
        """
        Agent requests additional resources mid-execution
        """
        current_contract = self.get_contract(agent_id)
        current_progress = self.assess_progress(agent_id)

        # Decision logic
        if current_progress > 0.8 and \
           additional_resources["tokens"] < 20000:
            # Approve modest extension for near-complete task
            self.extend_contract(agent_id, additional_resources)
            return True
        else:
            # Reject and suggest task decomposition
            return False
```

**Automatic Degradation**:
```python
def graceful_degradation(self, remaining_budget: dict):
    """Automatically adjust quality targets as budget depletes"""

    if remaining_budget["tokens"] < 10000:
        # Switch to smaller, more efficient model
        self.model = "small-model"  # e.g., gpt-4o-mini, claude-haiku
        self.reduce_context_window(max_tokens=4000)

    if remaining_budget["web"] == 0:
        # Disable web search, use only cached knowledge
        self.disable_tool("web_search")

    # Return partial results with confidence scores
    return self.compile_results(mark_incomplete=True)
```

### 3.5 Fundamental Constraints on Real-Time Enforcement

A critical consideration for contract enforcement is the **observability** of resource consumption during execution.

**The Single-Call Limitation**:

Current LLM APIs exhibit a fundamental constraint: token consumption is only known *after* a call completes, not during execution. This creates an important boundary on what contracts can enforce:

$$c_{tok}(t) = \begin{cases}
\text{unknown} & \text{during API call} \\
c_{actual} & \text{after API returns}
\end{cases}$$

**Implications for Enforcement**:

| Enforcement Type | Feasibility | Mechanism |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Pre-call estimation | Approximate | Heuristic models, historical data |
| Single-call hard limit | **Not possible** | Tokens unknown until completion |
| Multi-call cumulative | **Fully enforceable** | Stop subsequent calls after violation |
| Cost ceiling | Approximate | Upper bound via max_tokens parameter |

**Why This Matters**:

1. **Contracts cannot prevent** a single expensive call from exceeding budget
2. **Contracts can prevent** subsequent calls after budget is exceeded
3. The primary value is **multi-call protection**, not single-call prevention

**Current API Constraints**:

Even streaming APIs provide token usage only in the final chunk:

```python
# OpenAI streaming
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    stream=True,
    stream_options={"include_usage": True}  # Usage in final chunk only
)

# Gemini streaming
# usageMetadata available only in final response chunk
```

**Pre-execution Estimation**:

Contracts can use pre-call estimation to provide approximate enforcement:

$$\hat{c}_{tok} = f(|input|, task\_complexity, model\_characteristics)$$

Where $\hat{c}_{tok}$ is an estimate that may differ from actual consumption.

**Future Possibilities**:

Real-time token metering would require new API capabilities:

1. **Per-chunk token counts**: Report cumulative tokens with each streaming chunk
2. **Interruptible generation**: Allow mid-generation cancellation with partial output
3. **Token reservation**: Pre-allocate token budget with guaranteed limits

Such infrastructure would enable **true hard limits** on single calls:

```python
# Hypothetical future API with real-time metering
response = client.generate(
    prompt=task,
    hard_token_limit=5000,  # Guaranteed to stop at 5000 tokens
    on_budget_warning=callback  # Called at 80% consumption
)
```

**Practical Guidance**:

Given current constraints, contracts are most valuable for:

1. **Retry loops**: Prevent runaway retry costs
2. **Multi-step workflows**: Stop pipeline after phase exceeds budget
3. **Multi-agent systems**: Prevent downstream agents from executing
4. **Iterative refinement**: Limit improvement iterations
5. **Tool-heavy agents**: Control cumulative tool invocation costs

---

## 4. Multi-Agent Coordination

### 4.1 Hierarchical Contract Structure

Complex tasks can be decomposed into hierarchical contract structures:

```
ParentContract: 200K tokens, 100 API calls, 60 min
├─ SubContract_A (Research): 80K tokens, 40 API, 25 min
│  ├─ SubContract_A1 (Web Search): 30K tokens, 10 API, 10 min
│  └─ SubContract_A2 (Analysis): 50K tokens, 30 API, 15 min
├─ SubContract_B (Synthesis): 60K tokens, 20 API, 20 min
├─ SubContract_C (Verification): 40K tokens, 30 API, 10 min
└─ Reserve Buffer: 20K tokens, 10 API, 5 min
```

**Parent Agent Responsibilities**:
- Decompose task into subtasks
- Allocate resource budgets to child contracts
- Monitor child contract progress
- Reallocate resources from completed/failed contracts
- Synthesize results from child agents

**Allocation Strategy**:
```python
def allocate_resources(self, subtasks: list,
                      total_budget: dict) -> list:
    """
    Allocate parent budget across child contracts
    """
    # Reserve buffer (10% of budget)
    buffer = {r: total_budget[r] * 0.1 for r in total_budget}
    available = {r: total_budget[r] - buffer[r] for r in total_budget}

    # Allocate proportionally by estimated complexity
    total_complexity = sum(t.complexity for t in subtasks)

    allocations = []
    for task in subtasks:
        proportion = task.complexity / total_complexity
        allocation = {r: available[r] * proportion
                     for r in available}
        allocations.append(allocation)

    return allocations
```

### 4.2 Resource Markets and Trading

In systems with multiple concurrent agents, contracts enable resource trading:

**Resource Exchange Protocol**:
```python
class ResourceMarket:
    def __init__(self):
        self.offers = []
        self.demands = []

    def offer_resources(self, agent_id: str,
                       resource: str, amount: float):
        """Agent offers unused resources"""
        self.offers.append({
            "agent": agent_id,
            "resource": resource,
            "amount": amount,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        })

    def request_resources(self, agent_id: str,
                         resource: str, amount: float,
                         max_price: float):
        """Agent requests additional resources"""
        # Find matching offers
        matches = [o for o in self.offers
                  if o["resource"] == resource
                  and o["amount"] >= amount]

        if matches:
            # Execute trade
            offer = matches[0]
            self.transfer_resources(
                from_agent=offer["agent"],
                to_agent=agent_id,
                resource=resource,
                amount=amount
            )
            return True
        return False
```

**Priority-Based Allocation**:
```python
def allocate_scarce_resource(self, resource: str,
                            competing_agents: list):
    """
    Allocate scarce resources based on agent priority
    """
    # Calculate priority scores
    scores = []
    for agent in competing_agents:
        score = (
            agent.task_priority * 0.4 +
            agent.progress_rate * 0.3 +
            (1 - agent.budget_utilization) * 0.2 +
            agent.expected_completion * 0.1
        )
        scores.append((agent, score))

    # Sort by priority
    ranked = sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Allocate to highest priority agent
    return ranked[0][0]
```

### 4.3 Contract-Based Coordination Patterns

**Sequential Pipeline**:
```python
def sequential_pipeline(task, total_budget):
    """
    Chain of agents, each consuming output of previous
    """
    contracts = [
        Contract("DataCollector", budget=total_budget * 0.3),
        Contract("Analyzer", budget=total_budget * 0.4),
        Contract("Reporter", budget=total_budget * 0.3)
    ]

    result = task
    for contract in contracts:
        agent = spawn_agent(contract)
        result = agent.execute(result)
        if not contract.is_fulfilled():
            return partial_result(result, contract)

    return result
```

**Parallel Competition**:
```python
def parallel_competition(task, total_budget):
    """
    Multiple agents solve same task, best result wins
    """
    num_agents = 3
    budget_per_agent = total_budget / num_agents

    contracts = [
        Contract(f"Solver_{i}",
                budget=budget_per_agent,
                deadline=time.time() + 300)
        for i in range(num_agents)

### 4.4 The Coordination Overhead Problem

A fundamental tension exists in multi-agent budget allocation: **coordination itself consumes the resource being coordinated**. This creates a meta-optimization problem that must be explicitly addressed.

**The Paradox**:

Let $B$ be the total budget pool and $O$ be the overhead spent on coordination:

$$B_{effective} = B - O$$

Where $O > 0$ for any non-trivial coordination strategy.

**Formal Framework**:

Define the **coordination benefit function** $\phi(O)$ as the quality improvement from spending $O$ tokens on coordination:

$$Q_{coordinated} = Q_{baseline} + \phi(O)$$

The optimization problem becomes:

$$\max_O \left[ Q_{baseline} + \phi(O) \right] \text{ subject to } O \leq B \cdot \alpha_{max}$$

Where $\alpha_{max}$ is the maximum acceptable overhead fraction.

**Key Insight - Diminishing Returns**:

The benefit function $\phi(O)$ typically exhibits diminishing returns:

$$\frac{d\phi}{dO} > 0, \quad \frac{d^2\phi}{dO^2} < 0$$

This means additional coordination effort yields progressively smaller improvements.

**Coordination Strategy Spectrum**:

| Strategy | Overhead $O$ | Benefit $\phi(O)$ | Use When |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| No Coordination | 0 | 0 | Very small budgets |
| Heuristic | 0 | $\phi_h$ (fixed) | Simple task structures |
| Single-round | $O_1$ | $\phi_1$ | Medium budgets |
| Multi-round | $O_n > O_1$ | $\phi_n > \phi_1$ | Large budgets, complex tasks |

**The Break-Even Condition**:

Coordination is worthwhile when:

$$\phi(O) \cdot \frac{B - O}{B} > 0$$

Simplifying, coordination should be used when:

$$\frac{\phi(O)}{O} > \frac{Q_{baseline}}{B - O}$$

In other words: **marginal benefit per overhead token must exceed baseline quality per effective token**.

**Practical Break-Even Analysis**:

For typical coordination overhead of 500-2000 tokens:

| Total Budget $B$ | Overhead $O$ | Overhead % | Coordination Viable? |
|------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| 5,000 tokens | 500 | 10% | Rarely |
| 20,000 tokens | 500 | 2.5% | Sometimes |
| 50,000 tokens | 500 | 1% | Usually |
| 100,000+ tokens | 500 | <0.5% | Almost always |

**Coordination Strategies**:

**Strategy 1: Zero-Overhead Heuristic**

Pre-defined allocation based on task complexity estimates:

$$a_i = \frac{w_i}{\sum_j w_j} \cdot B$$

Where $w_i$ is the complexity weight for agent $i$.

- **Overhead**: $O = 0$
- **Quality**: Good for well-understood task structures
- **Limitation**: Cannot adapt to specific task characteristics

**Strategy 2: Single-Round Coordinator**

One LLM call to analyze tasks and allocate:

$$a = \text{LLM}(\text{``Analyze tasks } T_1...T_n \text{ and allocate budget } B\text{''})$$

- **Overhead**: $O \approx 500-1000$ tokens
- **Quality**: Adapts to specific task content
- **Limitation**: No iteration or refinement

**Strategy 3: Sealed-Bid Allocation**

Each agent submits a budget request; coordinator allocates proportionally:

$$a_i = \frac{r_i}{\sum_j r_j} \cdot B$$

Where $r_i$ is agent $i$'s requested budget.

- **Overhead**: $O \approx n \cdot 200$ tokens (one request per agent)
- **Quality**: Incorporates agent self-assessment
- **Limitation**: Agents may over-request strategically

**Strategy 4: Multi-Round Negotiation**

Iterative refinement with counter-proposals:

```
Round 1: Agents submit requests → 600 tokens
Round 2: Coordinator proposes allocation → 300 tokens
Round 3: Agents accept or counter-propose → 300 tokens
Round 4: Final allocation → 200 tokens
Total overhead: ~1400 tokens
```

- **Overhead**: $O \approx 1000-2000$ tokens
- **Quality**: Most sophisticated allocation
- **Limitation**: Diminishing returns after ~2-3 rounds

**Optimal Coordination Depth**:

The optimal number of negotiation rounds $n^*$ satisfies:

$$\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial n}\bigg|_{n=n^*} = \frac{\phi(n^*)}{B - O(n^*)}$$

Empirically, $n^* \leq 2$ for most practical scenarios.

**Theoretical Result - Heuristic Near-Optimality**:

**Proposition**: For tasks with well-defined structure, zero-overhead heuristic allocation achieves $\geq 90\%$ of optimal coordinated quality.

**Implication**: Sophisticated coordination is only justified when:
1. Total budget is large ($B > 50K$ tokens)
2. Task structure is highly variable or unknown
3. Quality requirements are stringent

**Coordination Protocol Design Principles**:

1. **Minimize rounds**: Each round has fixed overhead; prefer fewer, richer exchanges
2. **Front-load information**: Put most analytical effort in first round
3. **Use heuristics as fallback**: Default to zero-overhead strategy when budget is tight
4. **Set overhead caps**: Limit coordination to $\alpha_{max} \cdot B$ (typically 5%)

### 4.5 Contracting as a Capability

A powerful extension of Agent Contracts is treating **contracting itself as a capability**. Rather than all contracts being defined externally, agents with this capability can dynamically create subcontracts for delegated work.

**Formal Definition**:

An agent $A$ with the **contracting capability** can spawn child agents $A_1, A_2, ..., A_k$ with their own contracts $C_1, C_2, ..., C_k$, subject to **conservation laws** that ensure hierarchical budget discipline.

**The Conservation Law**:

For any parent contract $C$ with budget $B$, if it creates child contracts with budgets $b_1, b_2, ..., b_k$, the following must hold:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{k} b_i \leq B - u$$

Where $u$ is the parent's own resource consumption.

**Key Properties**:

1. **Budget Integrity**: Total delegated resources cannot exceed available resources
2. **Prevention of Over-allocation**: Conservation violations are caught at allocation time, not execution time
3. **Dynamic Reallocation**: When a child completes early, its unused allocation returns to the pool (budget pooling)

**Implementation Pattern**:

```python
class ContractingCapability:
    def __init__(self, parent_contract: Contract, reserve_ratio: float = 0.0):
        self.parent_contract = parent_contract
        self.reserve_ratio = reserve_ratio  # Reserve for coordination overhead
        self.allocations: dict[str, AllocationRecord] = {}

    @property
    def remaining_tokens(self) -> int:
        """Tokens available for delegation (conservation-aware)."""
        return (
            self.parent_budget_tokens
            - self.parent_used_tokens
            - self.total_allocated_tokens
            - self.reserved_tokens
        )

    def create_subcontract(self, name: str, tokens: int) -> Contract:
        """Create child contract with conservation law enforcement."""
        if tokens > self.remaining_tokens:
            raise ConservationViolationError(
                requested=tokens,
                available=self.remaining_tokens,
                parent_id=self.parent_contract.id
            )

        child = Contract(
            id=f"{self.parent_contract.id}/{name}",
            resources=ResourceConstraints(tokens=tokens)
        )
        self._record_allocation(name, tokens, child)
        return child

    def release_allocation(self, name: str) -> int:
        """Release child allocation back to pool (budget pooling)."""
        allocation = self.allocations.pop(name)
        return allocation.tokens_allocated  # Returns to remaining_tokens
```

**Verified Example: Report Generation Orchestrator**

The following example demonstrates hierarchical delegation with conservation law enforcement, verified through live execution with Gemini 3 Flash:

```
Orchestrator Contract: 150,000 tokens
├─ Reserve (coordination): 15,000 tokens
├─ Researcher Agent:      50,000 tokens
├─ Analyzer Agent:        40,000 tokens
└─ Reporter Agent:        45,000 tokens
─────────────────────────────────────────
   Total:                150,000 tokens ✓
   Remaining:                  0 tokens
   Conservation Satisfied: True
```

**Execution Log** (from live demo):
```
Reserved 15K for coordination | Remaining: 135,000
Researcher: 50K | Remaining: 85,000
Analyzer: 40K | Remaining: 45,000
Reporter: 45K | Remaining: 0

📊 Allocation Complete:
   Total Delegated:    150,000 tokens
   Remaining:          0 tokens
   Conservation OK:    True

Verification: 15K + 50K + 40K + 45K = 150,000 = parent budget ✓
```

**Conservation Violation Prevention**:

When attempting to over-allocate, the system prevents the violation:

```
Parent Budget: 50,000 tokens
Worker A allocated: 40,000 tokens | Remaining: 10,000

Attempting to allocate 15,000 more tokens...
(This exceeds remaining 10,000 tokens)

🛑 Conservation Violation Caught!
   Requested: 15,000 tokens
   Available: 10,000 tokens
```

**Budget Pooling (Dynamic Reallocation)**:

When an agent finishes early, its budget returns to the pool:

```
Initial:
  Worker A: 40,000 tokens | Remaining: 60,000
  Worker B: 40,000 tokens | Remaining: 20,000

Worker A finishes early - releasing allocation...
  Released: 40,000 tokens
  New remaining: 60,000 tokens

Now Worker C can receive larger allocation:
  Worker C: 55,000 tokens | Remaining: 5,000
```

**Comparison with Existing Frameworks**:

| Framework | Budget Model | Per-Agent Guarantees | Conservation Enforcement |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| LangGraph | Shared pool | ❌ None | ❌ No |
| CrewAI | Shared pool | ❌ None | ❌ No |
| AutoGen | Shared pool | ❌ None | ❌ No |
| **Agent Contracts** | **Allocated budgets** | **✓ Guaranteed** | **✓ Mathematical** |

**Value Proposition**:

Contracting as a capability enables:

1. **Multi-agent SLAs**: Each agent has a guaranteed budget allocation
2. **Fair resource sharing**: No agent can starve others by consuming the shared pool
3. **Predictable costs**: Budget allocation happens before execution, not after
4. **Enterprise governance**: Explicit contracts with audit trails for each delegation

## 6. Use Cases and Examples

### 6.1 Example 1: Research Report Generation

**Scenario**: Generate a comprehensive market research report

**Contract Specification**:

    name="Market Research Report",
    inputs={
        "topic": "Electric Vehicle Market in Europe",
        "depth": "comprehensive"
    },
    outputs={
        "schema": "markdown_report",

    )

    return report
```

**Time-Resource Tradeoff**:

| Mode | Time | Tokens | Web Searches | Quality |
|------|------|--------|--------------|---------|

### 6.2 Example 2: Code Review Agent

**Scenario**: Automated pull request review

**Contract Specification**:
```python
code_review_contract = Contract(
    name="PR Review Agent",
    inputs={
        "repository": "company/product",
        "pr_number": 1234,
        "files_changed": 15
    },
    outputs={
        "review_comments": List[ReviewComment],
        "overall_score": float,
        "approval_recommendation": bool
    },
    skills=["static_analysis", "security_scan", "style_check"],
    resources={
        "tokens": 30000,
        "api_calls": 25,  # GitHub API + analysis tools
        "cost": 1.50
    },
    temporal={
        "deadline": "5 minutes",  # Fast feedback
        "urgency": "high"
    }
)
```

**Budget Allocation Strategy**:
```python
def review_pull_request(contract):
    """Review PR with resource constraints"""

    files = fetch_pr_files(contract.inputs["pr_number"])
    num_files = len(files)

    # Allocate tokens per file
    tokens_per_file = contract.resources["tokens"] // num_files

    reviews = []
    for file in files:
        # Check remaining budget
        remaining = contract.resource_monitor.get_remaining("tokens")

        if remaining < tokens_per_file * 0.5:
            # Running low, use fast mode
            review = quick_review(file, max_tokens=remaining // 2)
        else:
            # Normal review
            review = thorough_review(file, max_tokens=tokens_per_file)

        reviews.append(review)

        # Check time pressure
        if contract.temporal_monitor.get_time_pressure() > 0.8:
            # Running out of time, summarize remaining files
            reviews.extend(batch_review(files[len(reviews):]))
            break

    return consolidate_reviews(reviews)
```

### 6.3 Example 3: Customer Support Multi-Agent System

**Scenario**: Handle customer support tickets with specialized agents

**Hierarchical Contract Structure**:
```python
# Coordinator Agent
coordinator_contract = Contract(
    name="Support Coordinator",
    resources={
        "tokens": 300000,
        "api_calls": 100,
        "duration": "1 hour"
    },
    temporal={
        "sla": "30 minutes",  # Response SLA
        "expiration": "24 hours"  # Agent lifecycle
    }
)

# Specialized Sub-Agents
specialist_contracts = {
    "triage": Contract(
        name="Triage Agent",
        resources={"tokens": 20000, "api": 10},
        temporal={"deadline": "2 minutes"}
    ),
    "technical": Contract(
        name="Technical Support",
        resources={"tokens": 100000, "api": 40, "web": 5},
        temporal={"deadline": "20 minutes"}
    ),
    "billing": Contract(
        name="Billing Support",
        resources={"tokens": 30000, "api": 20},
        temporal={"deadline": "10 minutes"}
    ),
    "escalation": Contract(
        name="Escalation Handler",
        resources={"tokens": 50000, "api": 20},
        temporal={"deadline": "15 minutes"}
    )
}
```

**Execution Flow**:
```python
def handle_support_ticket(ticket, coordinator_contract):
    """Route and handle support ticket"""

    # Triage (determine category and urgency)
    triage_agent = spawn_agent(specialist_contracts["triage"])
    category, urgency = triage_agent.classify(ticket)

    # Allocate resources based on urgency
    if urgency == "critical":
        # Relax resource constraints, tighten time
        specialist_contracts[category].resources["tokens"] *= 1.5
        specialist_contracts[category].temporal["deadline"] *= 0.5

    # Route to specialist
    specialist = spawn_agent(specialist_contracts[category])

    try:
        response = specialist.handle(ticket)

        if response.requires_escalation:
            # Escalate with remaining coordinator budget
            escalation = spawn_agent(specialist_contracts["escalation"])
            response = escalation.handle(ticket, context=response)

        return response

    except ContractViolation:
        # Graceful degradation
        return generate_holding_response(ticket)
```

### 6.4 Example 4: Data Pipeline with Quality-Speed Tradeoff

**Scenario**: Process large dataset with adjustable quality-speed tradeoff

**Adaptive Contract**:
```python
def create_adaptive_pipeline_contract(data_size, deadline, quality_target):
    """
    Create contract that adapts to data size and requirements
    """

    # Estimate base resources
    base_tokens = data_size * 100  # tokens per record
    base_api = data_size * 0.5     # API calls per record

    # Apply quality multiplier
    quality_multipliers = {
        "quick": 0.5,
        "standard": 1.0,
        "thorough": 2.0
    }
    multiplier = quality_multipliers[quality_target]

    return Contract(
        name=f"Data Pipeline - {quality_target}",
        resources={
            "tokens": int(base_tokens * multiplier),
            "api_calls": int(base_api * multiplier),
            "memory": f"{data_size * 10}MB"
        },
        temporal={
            "deadline": deadline,
            "time_budget": deadline * 0.9  # 10% buffer
        },
        outputs={
            "min_accuracy": 0.6 if quality_target == "quick" else 0.95
        }
    )
```

**Adaptive Processing**:
```python
def process_dataset(data, contract):
    """Process with adaptive quality based on constraints"""

    results = []

    for i, record in enumerate(data):
        # Calculate remaining budget per record
        records_remaining = len(data) - i
        tokens_per_record = (
            contract.resource_monitor.get_remaining("tokens")
            / records_remaining
        )

        # Adapt processing strategy
        if tokens_per_record > 500:
            # Thorough processing
            result = deep_analysis(record, max_tokens=500)
        elif tokens_per_record > 200:
            # Standard processing
            result = standard_analysis(record, max_tokens=200)
        else:
            # Quick processing
            result = quick_analysis(record, max_tokens=100)

        results.append(result)

        # Early exit if time running out
        if contract.temporal_monitor.get_time_pressure() > 0.95:
            # Process remaining records in batch
            results.extend(batch_process(data[i+1:]))
            break

    return results
```

## 7. Empirical Considerations

### 7.1 Performance Metrics

**Contract-Level Metrics**:

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Budget Utilization | $U_r = \frac{c_r}{b_r}$ | Resource efficiency |
| Time Efficiency | $U_t = \frac{t_{actual}}{t_{budget}}$ | Temporal efficiency |
| Quality Score | $Q = f(accuracy, completeness)$ | Output quality |
| Cost Effectiveness | $E = \frac{Q}{cost}$ | Quality per dollar |
| SLA Compliance | $\frac{\text{on-time completions}}{\text{total tasks}}$ | Reliability |

**System-Level Metrics**:
- **Throughput**: Tasks completed per hour
- **Resource Utilization**: Average budget utilization across all agents
- **Violation Rate**: Percentage of contracts violated
- **Renegotiation Frequency**: How often contracts need adjustment

### 7.2 Optimization Opportunities

**Historical Learning**:
```python
class ContractOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.history = []  # Contract execution history

    def suggest_contract(self, task_type: str):
        """Suggest optimal contract based on historical data"""

        # Filter similar past tasks
        similar = [h for h in self.history
                  if h.task_type == task_type]

        if not similar:
            return default_contract(task_type)

        # Analyze successful contracts
        successful = [h for h in similar
                     if h.state == ContractState.FULFILLED]

        # Calculate statistics
        avg_tokens = np.mean([h.tokens_used for h in successful])
        avg_time = np.mean([h.time_elapsed for h in successful])

        # Add buffer (20%)
        recommended = Contract(
            resources={
                "tokens": int(avg_tokens * 1.2),
                "api_calls": int(np.mean([h.api_calls for h in successful]) * 1.2)
            },
            temporal={
                "deadline": avg_time * 1.2
            }
        )

        return recommended
```

**A/B Testing Contracts**:
```python
def ab_test_contracts(task_type: str, n_trials: int = 100):
    """Test different contract configurations"""

    variants = {
        "aggressive": Contract(
            resources={"tokens": 50000, "time": 300}
        ),
        "moderate": Contract(
            resources={"tokens": 100000, "time": 600}
        ),
        "conservative": Contract(
            resources={"tokens": 150000, "time": 900}
        )
    }

    results = {v: [] for v in variants}

    for _ in range(n_trials):
        for variant_name, contract in variants.items():
            task = generate_task(task_type)
            result = execute_with_contract(task, contract)
            results[variant_name].append(result)

    # Analyze results
    for variant_name, outcomes in results.items():
        success_rate = sum(1 for o in outcomes
                          if o.state == ContractState.FULFILLED) / n_trials
        avg_cost = np.mean([o.total_cost for o in outcomes])
        avg_quality = np.mean([o.quality_score for o in outcomes])

        print(f"{variant_name}: {success_rate:.1%} success, "
              f"${avg_cost:.2f} cost, {avg_quality:.2f} quality")
```

### 7.3 Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Problem 1: Overly Restrictive Contracts**
- **Symptom**: High violation rate, low completion rate
- **Solution**: Implement automatic budget scaling based on task complexity

**Problem 2: Budget Waste**
- **Symptom**: Low utilization, excess budget remaining
- **Solution**: Reallocate unused budget to quality improvements or early termination

**Problem 3: Deadline Pressure**
- **Symptom**: Rushed outputs with low quality as deadline approaches
- **Solution**: Implement soft deadlines with graceful degradation strategies

**Problem 4: Resource Contention**
- **Symptom**: Multiple agents competing for scarce resources
- **Solution**: Implement priority queues and resource reservation systems

## 8. Future Directions

### 8.1 Machine Learning Integration

**Learned Resource Estimation**:
Train models to predict optimal resource allocation:
```python
class ResourcePredictor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = train_model(historical_contracts)

    def predict_requirements(self, task_description: str):
        """Predict optimal resources for task"""
        features = extract_features(task_description)
        predicted = self.model.predict(features)

        return {
            "tokens": predicted["tokens"],
            "api_calls": predicted["api_calls"],
            "time": predicted["time"],
            "confidence": predicted["confidence"]
        }
```

**Reinforcement Learning for Contract Negotiation**:
Agents learn to negotiate contracts optimally:
- State: Current budget, task progress, time remaining
- Actions: Request extension, reduce quality target, delegate subtask
- Reward: Task completion weighted by resource efficiency

### 8.2 Blockchain-Based Contract Enforcement

**Immutable Contract Records**:
- Store contracts on blockchain for auditability
- Smart contracts for automatic resource allocation
- Cryptographic verification of contract fulfillment

**Decentralized Agent Marketplaces**:
- Agents advertise capabilities via contracts
- Requesters post tasks with resource budgets
- Automated matching and execution

### 8.3 Cross-Organizational Contracts

**Federated Agent Systems**:
```yaml
cross_org_contract:
  parties:
    - organization: "CompanyA"
      agent: "ResearchAgent"
      contributes: {data: "market_data", resources: {tokens: 50K}}
    - organization: "CompanyB"
      agent: "AnalysisAgent"
      contributes: {skills: ["ml_analysis"], resources: {compute: "10 GPU-hours"}}

  shared_resources:
    tokens: 150000
    api_calls: 100

  resource_sharing:
    CompanyA_percentage: 60%
    CompanyB_percentage: 40%

  output_distribution:
    CompanyA: ["market_insights", "raw_data"]
    CompanyB: ["analysis_results", "ml_models"]
```

### 8.4 Human-in-the-Loop Contracts

**Approval Gates**:
```python
contract_with_human_approval = Contract(
    # ... standard fields ...
    approval_required=[
        {"stage": "before_expensive_operation",
         "threshold": {"cost": 10.00}},
        {"stage": "before_external_api",
         "apis": ["payment_api", "email_api"]},
        {"stage": "before_deadline_extension"}
    ]
)
```

**Dynamic Renegotiation with Humans**:
```python
def request_human_renegotiation(agent_id, reason):
    """
    Agent requests human approval for contract modification
    """
    notification = f"""
    Agent {agent_id} requests contract modification:

    Current State:
    - Progress: 75% complete
    - Resources: 90% of token budget consumed
    - Time: 80% of deadline elapsed

    Request:
    - Additional 30K tokens
    - 10-minute deadline extension

    Reason: {reason}

    [Approve] [Deny] [Modify]
    """

    return await_human_decision(notification)
```

## 9. Conclusion

### 9.1 Summary of Contributions

We have introduced **Agent Contracts** as a formal framework for governing autonomous AI agents through explicit resource and temporal constraints. The key contributions include:

1. **Formal Mathematical Framework**: A rigorous definition of agent contracts as multi-dimensional optimization problems with resource budgets, temporal constraints, and quality objectives.

2. **Time-Resource Tradeoff Surface**: Recognition that urgency and economy create a rich design space where agents can adapt strategies based on constraint priorities.

3. **Lifecycle Management**: Explicit contract states (drafted, active, fulfilled, violated, expired) that provide clear accountability and resource release mechanisms.

4. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Hierarchical contract structures and resource markets that enable sophisticated multi-agent collaboration without centralized control.

5. **Practical Implementation**: Concrete architectures, code examples, and integration patterns for real-world deployment.

### 9.2 Addressing the Original Motivation

Returning to our initial question: **Is "Agent Contract" more than another buzzword?**

**Yes**, when it emphasizes:
- **Executable constraints** that shape agent behavior, not just descriptions
- **Resource lifecycle management** with explicit allocation and deallocation
- **Time-resource tradeoffs** that enable strategic adaptation
- **Formal verification** of agent behavior against contract terms
- **Economic and governance** implications for enterprise deployment

**Not valuable** if it merely:
- Renames existing concepts (system prompts, tool specifications)
- Adds complexity without improving outcomes
- Becomes pure documentation without runtime enforcement

### 9.3 When to Use Agent Contracts

**Strong Fit**:
- Production systems with cost/performance requirements
- Multi-agent systems requiring resource coordination
- Enterprise deployments needing governance and audit trails
- Applications with hard SLAs or deadlines
- Research on optimal agent behavior under constraints

**Weak Fit**:
- Exploratory development where flexibility matters most
- Simple single-purpose agents with unlimited resources
- Contexts where human oversight handles all constraints
- Systems where contracts would add more overhead than value

### 9.4 Impact on the Field

Agent Contracts represent a shift from **unbounded agency** to **bounded optimization**. This has implications for:

**Research**: New optimization problems around contract design, resource allocation, and multi-agent coordination under constraints.

**Industry**: Practical governance mechanisms for deploying autonomous systems at scale with predictable costs and behavior.

**Policy**: Clear accountability frameworks for AI systems operating with explicit boundaries and termination conditions.

### 9.5 Call to Action

We propose that the AI community:

1. **Standardize contract specifications** similar to OpenAPI for REST APIs
2. **Build contract enforcement layers** into major agentic frameworks
3. **Develop benchmarks** for contract-aware agent performance
4. **Create contract marketplaces** where agents advertise capabilities
5. **Research optimal contract design** through empirical studies and theoretical analysis
6. **Implement conservation laws** for hierarchical delegation with mathematical guarantees

Agent Contracts are not the final answer to agentic AI governance, but they provide a concrete, implementable framework that addresses real production challenges. As the field matures from research prototypes to production systems, such formal mechanisms will become increasingly essential.
