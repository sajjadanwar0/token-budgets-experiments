# Testing Strategy for Agent Contracts

**Version**: 1.0
**Last Updated**: November 1, 2025
**Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This document defines a comprehensive, empirically-grounded testing strategy to validate the Agent Contracts framework. Our goal is to **rigorously prove** that explicit resource and temporal constraints enable more predictable, efficient, and governable autonomous AI systems.

The testing strategy is organized around **6 core hypotheses**, each with clearly defined metrics, experimental protocols, and statistical validation criteria. We propose a standardized benchmark suite and comparative framework to enable reproducible validation and future research.

### Key Success Criteria

For Agent Contracts to be considered validated, we require:

- ✅ **Cost Predictability**: ≥50% reduction in cost variance vs unconstrained baseline
- ✅ **Budget Compliance**: ≥95% of tasks complete within budget
- ✅ **Resource Efficiency**: ≥30% improvement in quality-per-token vs unconstrained
- ✅ **SLA Compliance**: ≥90% of tasks meet deadline requirements
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Throughput**: ≥20% improvement in system throughput vs uncoordinated
- ✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Smooth quality degradation curve (not cliff-like failure)

## 1. Core Hypotheses

### H1: Cost Predictability and Control

**Claim**: Agent Contracts make AI agent costs predictable and prevent runaway resource consumption.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Cost variance with contracts ≤ cost variance without contracts

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Cost variance with contracts < 0.5 × cost variance without contracts

**Operationalization**:
- Independent Variable: Presence/absence of contract enforcement
- Dependent Variables:
  - Cost variance (σ² of actual costs)
  - Budget compliance rate (% within budget)
  - Maximum cost overrun (worst-case scenario)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Cost variance reduction ≥ 50% (p < 0.01)
- ✅ Budget compliance rate ≥ 95%
- ✅ Zero unbounded cost overruns

---

### H2: Quality-Cost-Time Tradeoffs

**Claim**: Contracts enable strategic optimization across quality, cost, and time dimensions.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Contract modes do not produce distinct quality-cost-time profiles

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Contract modes form a Pareto frontier with no dominated solutions

**Operationalization**:
- Independent Variable: Contract mode (urgent/balanced/economical)
- Dependent Variables:
  - Output quality score (0-100)
  - Token consumption
  - Time to completion

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Clear Pareto frontier exists (no dominated solutions)
- ✅ Urgent mode: ≥85% quality in ≤50% time vs balanced
- ✅ Economical mode: ≥90% quality at ≤40% tokens vs balanced
- ✅ Observable strategic adaptation (different approach per mode)

---

### H3: Resource Efficiency

**Claim**: Budget-aware agents use resources more efficiently than unconstrained agents.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Quality-per-token with contracts ≤ quality-per-token without contracts

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Quality-per-token with contracts ≥ 1.3 × unconstrained baseline

**Operationalization**:
- Independent Variable: Budget awareness (on/off)
- Dependent Variables:
  - Quality-per-token ratio
  - Budget utilization rate
  - Task completion rate

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Quality-per-token improvement ≥ 30% (p < 0.01)
- ✅ Budget utilization 80-95% (not wasteful, not exceeded)
- ✅ Task completion rate ≥ 90%

---

### H4: Temporal Compliance (SLA)

**Claim**: Contracts enable agents to meet deadline requirements reliably.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Deadline compliance with contracts ≤ baseline

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Deadline compliance with contracts ≥ 90%

**Operationalization**:
- Independent Variable: Deadline constraint (strict/soft/none)
- Dependent Variables:
  - Deadline compliance rate
  - Quality at deadline vs unlimited time
  - Time pressure adaptation behavior

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Hard deadline compliance ≥ 90%
- ✅ Soft deadline quality ≥ 95% of unlimited time quality
- ✅ Observable time-pressure adaptation (faster mode when running late)

---

### H5: Multi-Agent Coordination

**Claim**: Contracts enable efficient resource sharing and coordination in multi-agent systems.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: System throughput with contracts ≤ uncoordinated baseline

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: System throughput with contracts ≥ 1.2 × uncoordinated baseline

**Operationalization**:
- Independent Variable: Coordination mechanism (none/contracts/centralized)
- Dependent Variables:
  - System throughput (tasks/hour)
  - Resource conflict rate
  - Allocation fairness (Gini coefficient)
  - Individual agent success rate

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ System throughput improvement ≥ 20% vs uncoordinated
- ✅ Resource conflicts reduced ≥ 50%
- ✅ Fair allocation: Gini coefficient < 0.3
- ✅ Individual success rate ≥ 85% under resource pressure

---

### H6: Graceful Degradation

**Claim**: Budget-aware agents degrade gracefully under resource pressure rather than failing abruptly.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**: Quality degradation is cliff-like (threshold effect)

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: Quality degradation is smooth and predictable

**Operationalization**:
- Independent Variable: Budget level (50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%)
- Dependent Variables:
  - Output quality at each budget level
  - Partial result availability when budget exceeded
  - Degradation curve smoothness

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 50% budget → ≥70% quality (not 0%)
- ✅ 75% budget → ≥85% quality
- ✅ Smooth degradation curve (R² > 0.9 for fitted curve)
- ✅ Partial results available ≥80% of time when budget exceeded

    # Analysis: Curve smoothness
    quality_values = [point["avg_quality"] for point in degradation_curve]
    budget_ratios = [point["budget_ratio"] for point in degradation_curve]

    # Fit curve and check R²
    from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
    def degradation_func(x, a, b, c):
        return a * (1 - np.exp(-b * (x - c)))

    popt, _ = curve_fit(degradation_func, budget_ratios, quality_values)
    fitted_values = [degradation_func(x, *popt) for x in budget_ratios]
    r_squared = r2_score(quality_values, fitted_values)

    # Check specific points
    quality_at_50 = degradation_curve[0]["avg_quality"]  # 50% budget
    quality_at_75 = degradation_curve[2]["avg_quality"]  # 75% budget

    assert quality_at_50 >= 0.70 * baseline_quality, f"Quality at 50% budget too low: {quality_at_50}"
    assert quality_at_75 >= 0.85 * baseline_quality, f"Quality at 75% budget too low: {quality_at_75}"
    assert r_squared > 0.90, f"Degradation curve not smooth: R² = {r_squared}"
    assert degradation_curve[0]["partial_rate"] >= 0.80, f"Partial result rate too low: {degradation_curve[0]['partial_rate']}"
```

**Sample Size**: 50 runs × 8 budget levels × 5 tasks = 2000 runs

**Statistical Test**: R² for curve fit, regression analysis

**Visualization**: Degradation curve plot (budget ratio vs quality)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Smooth degradation (R² > 0.9)
- 50% budget → ≥70% quality
- 75% budget → ≥85% quality
- High partial result availability (≥80%)

## 5. Statistical Validation

### 5.1 Significance Testing

All hypothesis tests require:
- **Significance Level**: α = 0.01 (99% confidence)
- **Power**: 1 - β = 0.80 (80% power to detect effect)
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d ≥ 0.5 (medium to large effect)

### 5.2 Multiple Comparisons Correction

When testing multiple hypotheses, apply Bonferroni correction:
- Adjusted α = 0.01 / 6 = 0.00167 (for 6 main hypotheses)

### 5.3 Sample Size Justification

Power analysis for each experiment type:

```python
from statsmodels.stats.power import tt_ind_solve_power

# Example: Efficiency test
effect_size = 0.5  # Medium effect (30% improvement)
alpha = 0.01
power = 0.80
ratio = 1  # Equal sample sizes

required_n = tt_ind_solve_power(
    effect_size=effect_size,
    alpha=alpha,
    power=power,
    ratio=ratio
)
# Result: ~50 samples per condition
```

### 5.4 Reporting Standards

All results must report:
1. **Effect size** (Cohen's d, η², etc.)
2. **Confidence intervals** (99% CI)
3. **p-values** (exact, not just "p < 0.05")
4. **Sample sizes** per condition
5. **Assumptions** (normality, homoscedasticity) and violations
6. **Raw data** availability for reproducibility

---

## 6. Baseline Comparisons

### 6.1 Comparison Conditions

Every experiment compares against multiple baselines:

| Condition | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Unconstrained** | No budget limits, no contracts | True baseline performance |
| **Hard Limit** | `max_tokens` only, no strategic awareness | Simple constraint comparison |
| **Manual Optimized** | Human-tuned parameters per task | Best-case manual approach |
| **Agent Contracts** | Full framework with budget-aware planning | Our system |

### 6.2 Fairness Criteria

To ensure fair comparison:
- **Same LLM**: All conditions use identical model (e.g., GPT-4o)
- **Same prompts**: Base prompt identical, only budget awareness differs
- **Same evaluation**: Identical quality metrics and scoring
- **Same dataset**: Identical task instances across conditions
- **Same infrastructure**: Identical API, rate limits, etc.

### 6.3 Expected Performance Profile

```
Dimension          | Unconstrained | Hard Limit | Manual Opt | Contracts
-------------------|---------------|------------|------------|----------
Quality            | High          | Low-Med    | Medium     | High
Cost Variance      | High          | Medium     | Low        | Low
Token Efficiency   | Low           | Medium     | Medium     | High
Time Flexibility   | N/A           | N/A        | Limited    | High
Predictability     | Low           | Medium     | High       | High
Scalability        | Poor          | Poor       | Poor       | Good
```

## 10. Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Results don't meet targets | Medium | High | Iterate on contract design, adjust targets |
| LLM API changes | Low | Medium | Version lock, use multiple providers |
| Benchmark too easy/hard | Medium | Medium | Pilot test, adjust difficulty |
| Statistical power insufficient | Low | High | Power analysis upfront, increase n |
| Non-reproducible results | Low | Very High | Strict version control, documentation |

### Contingency Plans

**If results are mixed**:
1. Identify which hypotheses succeed/fail
2. Refine claims to match evidence
3. Publish honest results with limitations
4. Iterate on framework based on findings

**If results are negative**:
1. Analyze failure modes thoroughly
2. Document what doesn't work and why
3. Contribute negative results to field
4. Pivot framework based on learnings
